# Charmed MetalLB tutorial
The Charmed MetalLB Operator delivers automated operations management from day 0 to day 2
on the [MetalLB Load Balancer Implementation for Bare Metal Kubernetes](https://metallb.universe.tf/).
It is an open source, production-ready charm on top of [Juju](https://juju.is/)

As a first step this tutorial shows you how to get Charmed MetalLB up and running, but the tutorial does not stop there. In this tutorial we will walk through how to:
- Set up an environment using Kubernetes and [Juju](https://juju.is/).
- Deploy MetalLB using a single command.
- Configure the IPAddressPool.

While this tutorial intends to guide and teach you as you deploy Charmed MetalLB, it will be most beneficial if you already have a familiarity with:
- Basic terminal commands.
- MetalLB concepts.
